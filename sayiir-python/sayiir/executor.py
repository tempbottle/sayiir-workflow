    """Run a workflow to completion and return its output.

    When called without ``instance_id`` / ``backend``, runs entirely in
    memory with no persistence (fastest path for prototyping).

    When called **with** ``instance_id`` and ``backend``, runs with full
    checkpointing and durability — but still returns the output directly
    instead of a :class:`WorkflowStatus` object.  If the workflow does not
    complete (e.g. it parks on a delay or signal), a :class:`WorkflowError`
    is raised.  Use :func:`run_durable_workflow` when you need the full
    status object.

    Args:
        workflow: The workflow to run (produced by ``Flow.build()``)
        input_data: Input to the first task
        instance_id: Unique execution instance ID (enables durability)
        backend: Persistence backend (``InMemoryBackend`` or
            ``PostgresBackend``).  Required when ``instance_id`` is given.
        conflict_policy: What happens when ``instance_id`` already exists.
            One of ``"fail"`` (default), ``"use_existing"``, or
            ``"terminate_existing"``.

    Returns:
        The workflow output.

    Raises:
        WorkflowError: If the durable workflow did not complete.

    Example::

        # Prototype — no persistence
        result = run_workflow(workflow, 21)

        # Production — same function, just add params
        result = run_workflow(workflow, 21, instance_id="run-1", backend=pg)
